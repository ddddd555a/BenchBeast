# BenchBeast
Bodybuilding is a universal sport community that focuses on muscle growth. The goal and purpose may differ in bodybuilding. But bench press is one of the most basic yet important exercises for chest muscle growth which almost every person in the gym never skips. 

In this project, I am asking 5 questions to test if the person is knowledgeable in bench press.
And the last 3 questions is a tool that users can use to see what stimulus point is used in particular poses in bench press.
