# BenchBeast
Bodybuilding is a universal sport community that focuses on muscle growth. The goal and purpose may differ in bodybuilding. But bench press is one of the most basic yet important exercises for chest muscle growth which almost every person in the gym never skips. 

In this project, I am asking 5 questions to test if the person is knowledgeable in bench press.

-List of questions

 In the first 5 questions the quiz asks correct posture and method in breathing, wrist angle, shoulder, speed of bar path, and bar grabbing position. Users can choose answers from the question to see if they are bench press freaks or not.
 
 
 Next, we have a tool for chest muscle simulation. This helps to check which muscle is used in a certain posture. I chose three most important postures that decide the stimulus point of the chest: Armpit angle, waist arch, angle of a bench.



And the last 3 questions is a tool that users can use to see what stimulus point is used in particular poses in bench press.
